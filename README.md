# Project Description
In this project, we conducted a detailed revenue analysis for "Atliq," a hotel chain facing a decline in revenue. The primary goal was to analyze the reasons behind the drop in revenue, explore trends, and provide actionable insights using data analytics. Power BI was utilized to create a dynamic dashboard that allows for real-time exploration of key performance indicators (KPIs) such as occupancy rates, average daily rate (ADR), and revenue per available room (RevPAR).

## The project involved:

1) Data Collection: Historical booking data, customer demographics, seasonal trends, and external factors impacting the hotel industry.
2) Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing the dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy.
3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing trends, outliers, and correlations between different variables affecting revenue.
4) Dashboard Creation: Power BI was used to build a dynamic, interactive dashboard to visualize trends in revenue, occupancy rates, ADR, and other KPIs over time. The dashboard helps management identify potential problems and make data-driven decisions.

## Features
-> Comprehensive Data Analysis: Analyze revenue trends, customer demographics, and occupancy patterns.

-> Dynamic Dashboard: An interactive Power BI dashboard displaying key performance metrics (KPI) such as revenue, ADR, occupancy rate, and RevPAR.

-> Insights: Identify the most significant factors affecting revenue and suggest strategies for improvement.

## Dashboard Overview
The Power BI dashboard offers the following features:

• Revenue Trends: Monthly, quarterly, and yearly breakdowns of revenue.

• Occupancy Rate: Analysis of room occupancy trends.

• ADR and RevPAR: Key metrics such as Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR).

• Customer Segments: Revenue breakdown by customer demographics.

• Seasonal and External Factors: Visualizations of the impact of external factors like holidays, events, and weather conditions on revenue.
